# 411-project

## Get started
First, install node 
```
https://nodejs.org/en/
```
Recommended (Version 14.x.x) is fine

## Project setup
Clone the repo into whatever folder you want and run
```
npm install
```

After that runs, type
```
npm install nodemon
```

Hopefully this will set everything up

### How to run for development
Enter the folder you created and where you typed 'npm install' and type
```
npm run serve
```
This should create a server on localhost:8080 that you can navigate to

### If that doesn't work
uh oh
